# Terrain generation
This project foceuses on proplematics of procedural generation and optimization of 3D rendering
This procet is build on Unity version 2021.3.20f1 LTS

## Features
In version 1.0.0 you can find all the feature that are required in my assignment
List of feature in 1.0.0
- user can specify some terrain feature
- optimized rendering of 3D meshes including
    - dynamic reduction of polygons based on camera view distance
    - basic LOD system for trees
- basic UI including
    - main menu
    - pause and settings menu

## Future
This project will serve as testing ground for all kinds of procedural generation algorythms and optimization techniques

In future works i would like to following:
- rework mesh builder so that is uses marching cubes algorythm
    - real-time terrain modification
    - building system
- generation of complex structures like vilages, powerlines and railroad network
